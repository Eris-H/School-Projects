    <h1> <br>LOG #4326 </h1>

    <!-- the two different subjects have their own sections in the log, as such I'm using a smaller header for both of them -->
    <h2> Subject: Sicco </h2>

    <!-- This button should grow due to its class -->
    <button class = "growButton">IF GROWS ON HOVER, SUBJECT HAS ESCAPED</button>

    <!-- I have the image before the first break and aligned to the right so it appears next to the paragraph, i also sized it down in photoshop -->
    <p>
        The subject has shown an incredible aptitude for killing. Luckily her atunement hasn't negatively  <img align = "right"  src = "sand.jpg"/> <br>    
        affected this. I had my suspicions initially due to sand not being a very dangerout object on paper. <br>
        However, her creativity proved that to be no issue. Her biggest weakness though, is her sacrifice. <br>
        Ones consitution is a risky sacrifice without a very mobile atunement, so I fear for her fragility. <br>
        This subject fights with blinding precision, using her sand to blind opponents, and cutting them down <br>
        from where they least expect it, ending most fights in an instant. She harbors no qualms with <br>
        violence and follows orders to a tee. However, she has been growing an intrest in the outside world. <br>
        I do not believe she is ready for the outside world, and has much more conditioning to go through <br>
        before she should be allowed.
    </p>

    <!-- the second header area -->
    <h2> Subject: Sanguis </h2>

    <!-- this button shouldn't grow -->
    <button> IF GROWS ON HOVER, SUBJECT HAS ESCAPED </button>

    <!-- I have the image before the first break and aligned to the right so it appears next to the paragraph, i also sized it down in photoshop -->
    <p>
        The subject is the only rival to Sicco's ability to kill. Her atunement is part of the reason.  <img align = "right"  src = "blood.jpg"/> <br>   
        Ironically, her cold-bloodedness allows her atunement to her own blood to be highly dangerous. <br>
        Her sacrifice was her metabolism. Like a vampire, she can only nourish herself from the blood of other <br>
        creatures. This subjects combat style takes advantage of her control of her blood, hardening it to <br>
        create spines or spikes, as well as shielding herself from attacks. Her loyalty is even greater than <br>
        Sicco's, and unlike Sicco has no intrest in anything beside what the Empire plans for her. <br>
        She actually seems to revel in violence, as she only seems to smile in the arena, never in the daycare. <br>
    </p>

    <!-- final header -->
    <h2> Conclusion </h2>

    <!-- final paragraph -->
    <p>
        Both subjects are going to be very useful to the Empire. Sicco may be more tricky to manage, <br>
        But I'm sure the fact Sanguis rivals her combat prowess, will be enough to keep her in check. <br>
        For both of them, I'm glad we managed to aquire them at a young age. Training from childhood is essential to enforce proper loyalty to the Empire.
